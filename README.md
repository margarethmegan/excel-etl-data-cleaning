# 📊 Excel ETL Project – Real-World Data Cleaning in Accounting

A multi-part case study developed by **Ernst & Young**, this project simulates a real-world ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow using Excel. It focuses on identifying, cleaning, parsing, and transforming raw accounting data into a structured and analyzable format—building essential skills for data-driven business decision-making.

## 🏫 Context

- 📅 **Date**: January 2025  
- 🏫 **Institution**: Pepperdine University  
- 👩🏻‍💻 **Course**: Accounting Information Systems

## 🔍 Project Overview

This hands-on project spans **five Excel workbooks**, each presenting a new data challenge such as:

- Complex text extraction and parsing
- Reconstruction of fragmented employee records
- Removal of duplicate and corrupted data
- Table lookups and joins
- Application of advanced Excel formulas for transformation

## 💼 Key Case Example

### Case 2: Data Parsing and Reconstruction  
Transformed a composite field (`EmployeeCode`) into multiple structured fields using functions like `TEXTSPLIT()`, `MID()`, `LEFT()`, and `FIND()`, showcasing Excel’s ability to handle structured parsing logic without code.

## 🧰 Tools & Skills Used

- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Advanced formulas: `IFERROR()`, `VLOOKUP()`, `TEXTSPLIT()`, `LEFT()`, `MID()`, `TRIM()`, etc.
  - Data cleaning and normalization
  - Table joins and cross-referencing
- **Business Analytics Mindset**
  - Attention to data integrity
  - Logical transformation steps
  - Reusable workflows in Excel
